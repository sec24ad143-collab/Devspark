GRIEV-AI: Smart Citizen Grievance & Root-Cause Insight Platform
(Using: React.js + React Router + Context/Redux + Node.js + Express + MongoDB + JWT + bcrypt + Tailwind/MUI)

🧭 1️⃣ Problem Overview
Government grievance portals exist, but they are slow, manual, and reactive.
Citizens submit complaints, but:

Urgent ones get buried under less important ones.

There’s no AI-based insight into recurring civic problems.

People can’t easily track complaint progress or patterns in their area.

💡 2️⃣ Objective
To create a 100% software-based, AI-ready grievance system that:

Makes complaint filing & tracking effortless for citizens.

Automatically classifies issues & assigns them to departments.

Generates data-driven insights for government to act faster.

🧠 3️⃣ System Workflow (Step-by-Step Flow)
A. User (Citizen) Side Workflow
1️⃣ Registration / Login

Citizen signs up using name, email, and password.

Password is hashed using bcrypt.

JWT token is generated upon login for secure session handling.

2️⃣ Dashboard

After login, user lands on their personal dashboard.

Can view all complaints filed, their status, and feedback history.

3️⃣ Create a New Grievance

Citizen clicks “Report Issue”, fills form:

Title, Description, Category (water, power, sanitation), Location.

Optionally attaches photo (Cloudinary API later).

Form validation done via React + Formik.

Complaint is submitted via POST API → saved in MongoDB.

4️⃣ AI-Based Categorization (Rule-Based for MVP)

Backend auto-tags complaint category based on keywords:

“Leak”, “Water” → Water Department

“Pothole”, “Road” → PWD

“Garbage”, “Smell” → Sanitation

Status = “Pending” initially.

5️⃣ Complaint Tracking

Citizen sees real-time status updates:

⏳ Pending → ⚙ In Progress → ✅ Resolved

Can add feedback or close complaint.

B. Admin (Government) Side Workflow
1️⃣ Admin Login

Admin logs in using separate credentials (role: “admin”).

2️⃣ View Dashboard

Can view:

All complaints (sorted by urgency, department, or area).

Filter: Category | Status | Date | Location.

3️⃣ Update Status

Admin opens a complaint → updates status:

Pending → In Progress → Resolved.

Adds notes like “Forwarded to Water Dept.”

4️⃣ Analytics & Insights

Admin dashboard uses Material UI tables + Chart.js to show:

Top complaint categories (pie chart).

Area-wise issue density (bar graph).

Time to resolve (line chart).

Root cause patterns (later AI phase): e.g., “Drainage issues spike during monsoon.”

C. Backend Workflow (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
1️⃣ Auth Flow

bcrypt hashes password before storing.

JWT is issued on login → attached to all API calls in headers.

Middleware verifies token for protected routes.

2️⃣ CRUD API Layer

Operation	Route	Access
Create Grievance	POST /api/grievances	Citizen
Get All	GET /api/grievances	Admin
Get User Complaints	GET /api/grievances/user/:id	Citizen
Update Status	PATCH /api/grievances/:id	Admin
Delete	DELETE /api/grievances/:id	Admin

3️⃣ MongoDB Schema

js
Copy code
User {
  name, email, password, role: 'citizen' | 'admin', createdAt
}

Grievance {
  userId, title, description, category, location,
  status: 'Pending' | 'In Progress' | 'Resolved',
  createdAt, updatedAt
}
D. Frontend Workflow (React + Tailwind + Context/Redux)
1️⃣ Routing (React Router)

Route	Component	Description
/login	<Login />	JWT-based login
/register	<Register />	Signup form
/dashboard	<Dashboard />	Citizen view of complaints
/grievances/new	<GrievanceForm />	Submit new issue
/admin	<AdminPanel />	Admin dashboard

2️⃣ Context/Redux State

Global store manages:

user (auth info)

grievances (list of complaints)

token (JWT)

3️⃣ UI Components

Navbar → role-based menu

ComplaintCard → status + category

AnalyticsChart → admin graphs

Modal → update status

🧩 4️⃣ Complete Workflow Diagram
css
Copy code
Citizen → [React UI Form] 
        → [POST /grievances API] 
        → [Express Server validates JWT + saves to MongoDB]
        → [Admin Dashboard fetches complaints]
        → [Admin updates status → PUT /grievances/:id]
        → [Citizen dashboard updates automatically]
📊 5️⃣ Example User Journey
Step	User Action	System Response
1	User logs in	JWT generated
2	Files complaint “Water leak near main road”	Saved + auto-tagged “Water Dept.”
3	Admin views dashboard	Sees high-priority issue (keyword: leak)
4	Admin updates → “In Progress”	Citizen notified
5	Admin resolves → “Fixed pipeline”	Citizen sees “Resolved”
6	System logs duration + generates insight	“Water issues increased in Ward 4”

🧠 6️⃣ Future Roadmap (2-Year Vision)
Phase	Goal	Tech Addition
MVP (3 Months)	Web portal with CRUD + JWT	React + Node + MongoDB
Phase 2	Add AI classification & insights	Flask microservice
Phase 3	Real-time notifications	Socket.io
Phase 4	Mobile app (React Native)	REST API reuse
Phase 5	Multi-language + Gov API integration	i18n + CPGRAMS API

🌟 7️⃣ Outcome
✅ Helps citizens get faster, transparent grievance resolution.
✅ Helps government detect recurring issues through data.
✅ Uses only software — lightweight, scalable, and AI-ready.
✅ Startup potential as GovTech SaaS or civic engagement platform.
